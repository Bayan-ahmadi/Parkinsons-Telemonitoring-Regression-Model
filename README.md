# Parkinsons-Telemonitoring-Regression-Model
Using machine learning, this research forecasts total_UPDRS scores from a Parkinson telemonitoring dataset. The evaluation of models like the Extra Trees Regressor and Random Forest Regressor was based on RMSE, MAE, and MSE. In addition, a proper feature engineering was carried out to ensure the most relevant attributes fed into the models.
